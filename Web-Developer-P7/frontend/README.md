## TODOS

DONT FORGET TO PUSH TO GIT REGULARLY


- call API to get actual list of posts from backend

FAIT:
- rename view `Post.js` to `Posts.js` (and also the associated CSS sheet)
- routes login / signup from the frontend
- create a `Post` *component* // empty for the moment
- show in chronological order a list of n posts with all expected fields
